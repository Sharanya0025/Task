        <p>
          OnePlus was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president
          Pete Lau and Carl Pei. According to Chinese public records,
          OnePlus' only institutional shareholder is Oppo Electronics.</br> Lau
          denied that OnePlus was a wholly owned subsidiary of Oppo and stated
          that Oppo Electronics and not Oppo Mobile (the phone manufacturer) is
          a major investor of OnePlus and that they are "in talks with other
          investors", although OnePlus has confirmed it uses Oppo's
          manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with
          Oppo.[</br> The company's main goal was to design a smartphone that would
          balance high-end quality with a lower price than other phones in its
          class, believing that users would "Never Settle" for the lower-quality
          devices produced by other companies. Lau explained that "we will never
          be different just for the sake of being different. Everything done has
          to improve the actual user experience in day-to-day use.</br>" He
          also showed aspirations of being the "Muji of the tech industry",
          emphasizing its focus on high-quality products with simplistic,
          user-friendly designs. Continuing Lau's association with the
          platform from the Oppo N1, OnePlus entered into an exclusive
          licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to base its products' Android
          distribution upon a variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod and
          use its trademarks outside of China.</br> The company unveiled its
          first device, the OnePlus One, on 23 April 2014 which was intended to
          capture market from the Google Nexus series. In December 2014,
          alongside the release of the OnePlus One in India exclusively through
          Amazon, OnePlus also announced plans to establish a presence in the
          country, with plans to open 25 official walk-in service centers across
          India. In April 2014, OnePlus hired Han Han to help market its
          products in mainland China.</br></br><img src="img/Oneplus nord.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli" /></br>Model: AC2001 (India) · AC2003 (Europe)</br>
