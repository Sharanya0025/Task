        <h1>Vivo</h1>
        <p>
          In the first quarter of 2015, Vivo was ranked among the top 10
          smartphone makers, achieving a global market share of 2.7%. Since
          its founding in 2009, Vivo has expanded to over 100 countries around
          the world. International expansion began in 2014, when the company
          entered the Thailand market.</br>Vivo quickly followed up with launches
          in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and
          Vietnam. In 2017, Vivo entered the smartphone market in Russia, Sri
          Lanka, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brunei, Macau, Cambodia, Laos, Bangladesh,
          and Nepal.</br>In June 2017, it entered the Pakistan mobile
          phone market and the Vivo brand is currently experiencing rapid growth
          in popularity in the country. In October 2020, Vivo announced
          that it would begin to sell its products also in Europe.</br> On 17
          December 2020, Vivo and Zeiss announced a long-term strategic
          partnership to jointly promote and develop breakthrough innovations in
          mobile imaging technology. The first “Vivo Zeiss co-engineered imaging
          system” will be featured in the Vivo X60 series. As part of the
          collaboration agreement, Vivo and Zeiss will establish the Vivo Zeiss
          Imaging Lab, a joint R&D program to innovate mobile imaging technology
          for Vivo’s flagship smartphones.</br> In April 2021, three pallets of
          VIVO phones caught fire at Hong Kong International Airport, prompting
          a ban on air freight of VIVO phones through Hong Kong.</br></br><img src="img/Vivo x60.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli" /></br>
