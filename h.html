        <h1>Huawei</h1>
        <p>
          Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (/ˈhwɑːweɪ/ WHAH-way; Chinese: 华为;
          pinyin: About this soundHuáwéi) is a Chinese multinational technology
          company headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong.</br> It designs, develops,
          and sells telecommunications equipment and consumer electronics.
          The company was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former Deputy
          Regimental Chief in the People's Liberation Army. Initially focused
          on manufacturing phone switches, Huawei has expanded its business to
          include building telecommunications networks, providing operational
          and consulting services and equipment to enterprises inside and
          outside of China, and manufacturing communications devices for the
          consumer market.</br>Huawei has over 194,000 employees as of
          December 2019. Huawei has deployed its products and services in
          more than 170 countries and areas.It overtook Ericsson in 2012 as
          the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the
          world,and overtook Apple in 2018 as the second-largest
          manufacturer of smartphones in the world, behind Samsung
          Electronics.</br> In 2018, Huawei reported that its annual revenue was
          US$108.5 billion.In July 2020, Huawei surpassed Samsung and Apple
          to become the top smartphone brand (in number of phones shipped) in
          the world for the first time. This was primarily due to a drop in
          Samsung's global sales in the second quarter of 2020, owing to the
          impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</br></br><img src="img/Huawei p30 pro.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli" /></br>
